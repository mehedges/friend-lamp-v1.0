# friend-lamp-v1.0
This is my take on the friend lamp project! It is very important to note this project is based off of the one by tmckay. I created this repository because I definitely deviated from the instructions there, and this repository is coming from & made for people that might not have previous experience with RaspberryPi and web services. I am more hardware-oriented and did not realizze the project had heavy software requirements. If tmckay would like me to edit this or take it down, I definitely will; but again, this is just my spin on the project. I highly recommend checking out their project here:
