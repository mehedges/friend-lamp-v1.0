# friend-lamp-v1.0
This is my take on the friend lamp project! It is very important to note this project is based off of the one by tmckay. I created this repository because I definitely deviated from the instructions there, and this repository is coming from & made for people that might not have previous experience with RaspberryPi and web services. I am more hardware-oriented and did not realizze the project had heavy software requirements. If tmckay would like me to edit this or take it down, I definitely will; but again, this is just my spin on the project. I highly recommend checking out their project here:

## Plans for Future Updates
I originally made this project for my mom while I'm away at college, since she mentions she worries about me sometimes (in a sweet way lol). But, I also have online friends in Europe that requested a lamp for themselves, which would be awesome if I got it working worldwide. Technically, that should be possible. Also, I have so many ideas for a newer, 'updated' version of the one I just made for my mom. Of course she will get the first updated lamp, but I will also make another folder and everything for v2.0.
