# Beginners Starting Point
Hello! Real talk, I did NOT have any experience with RaspberryPi before this project, but it can be a great intro on how to use one! It's important to keep in mind that RaspberryPi is nothing like an Arduino- it's essentially a mini computer. And what do all computers need? An operating system (called an "OS")! Before turnng on your Pi, you're going to need to flash that 8 GB SD card. This puts an OS on the card and therefore, on the Pi.
